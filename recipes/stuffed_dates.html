    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Dates are a traditional way to break fast. This delicious recipe can be made quickly and easily, which makes it a great treat to break your fast with. You can choose to follow the recipe or try different cheeses for the filling, such as goat's cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese</li>
        <li>36 pitted dates</li>
        <li>36 walnut pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix cream cheese and Gorgonzola cheese together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut a slit into each date so they can be spread flat. Spread cheese mixture into each date; top with a walnut piece.</li>
        <li>You can put the cheese mixture into a zip-type bag, cut a hole in one corner, and squeeze mixture into the date. I feel you lose too much cheese in the bag doing it this way.</li>
    </ol>
